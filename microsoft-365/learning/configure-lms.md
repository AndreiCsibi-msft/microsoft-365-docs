# Add learning management systems for Microsoft Viva Learning

A growing set of learning management systems are available through Viva Learning. This set may change at any time as more providers join or change their status with the program.

Learning management systems are not enabled by default. To enable these sources, you will need to [add them in the Microsoft 365 admin center](content-sources-365-admin-center.md#configure-settings-for-the-learning-content-sources) and follow the specific instructions shown in the following table.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need a Premium license to connect learning management systems. [Learn more about licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/learning).

>[!NOTE]
>It can take 24 to 48 hours for Viva Learning users to see content for the sources you enabled in the admin portal.
