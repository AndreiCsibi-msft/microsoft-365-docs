2. Navigate to **Settings**, then **Org settings**. Select Viva Learning, and enable Cornerstone OnDemand in the panel.
3. Fill in the configuration details that you retrieved from your Cornerstone Portal.

    >[!NOTE]
    >The display name is the name of the carousel under which Cornerstone learning content will appear for your organization in Viva Learning. If you don't enter a name, it will display the default name "Cornerstone OnDemand".
