# Configure Skillsoft as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure Skillsoft as a third-party learning content source in Viva Learning.

>[!NOTE]
>Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. Skillsoft content and any associated services are subject to Skillsoft's privacy and service terms.

## Configure in your Skillsoft portal

You'll need to reach out to your Skillsoft account team to enable Viva Learning integration. Your account team will also provide you with the Organization ID and Service Account Key. You'll need these for the next step.

You can contact [Skillsoft Support](https://support.skillsoft.com/percipio/) for help with getting in touch with your account team. If you are not yet a customer, you can discuss your options by [contacting Skillsoft directly](https://www.skillsoft.com/about/contact-us).

## Configure in your Microsoft 365 admin center

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have admin permissions in Microsoft 365 to complete these steps.

1. Navigate to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in.

2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Org settings**. Search for Viva Learning and enable Skillsoft from the options.

3. Fill in the configuration details you got from your Skillsoft account team.

4. Select **Save** to save the configuration details and complete the setup process.

>[!NOTE]
>Tenant metadata is stored centrally in our data stores and not stored in geo-specific data stores.

>[!NOTE]
>Currently, all the users within an organization can discover all the tenant-specific courses but they will only be able to use the courses that they have access to. User-specific content discovery based on roles and permissions is planned for future releases.
