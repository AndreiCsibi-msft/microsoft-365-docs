# Configure SAP SuccessFactors as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure SAP SuccessFactors as a third-party content source for Microsoft Viva Learning. First, you'll need to edit the system configuration in the SuccessFactors Portal, then you'll need to complete the configuration in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

>[!NOTE]
>Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. SAP SuccessFactors content and any associated services are subject to the SAP SuccessFactors privacy and service terms.

## Configure the SuccessFactors portal

>[!Note]
> The admin who enables this feature must have access to the SuccessFactors Learning administrator application.

1. Obtain the required workflows to edit the PARTNER_EXTRACT configuration, which you can get to by going to **System Administration** > **Configuration** > **System Configuration** > **PARTNER_EXTRACT**.

2. Use the PGP tool to generate the PGP key (Public key, Private Key, Private Key Passphrase) of your preferred size. While generating the PGP key, you can select RSA algorithm, which is recommended. GNUPG tool is one of the PGP keys generation tools that you can use.

3. Fill in the following parameters in the PARTNER_EXTRACT configuration. To edit the partner extract configuration in SuccessFactors, you'll need **Edit System Configuration** workflow permission in SuccessFactors.

    - customer notification email for all job status
        - defaultJob.email=
    
    - Partner1
        - PartnerID maximum length is 10 characters. This can be your LMS tenant ID.
    partners1.partnerID=
    
    - EncryptionKey is the PGP public encryption key, which is the entire section between BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK and END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
        - partners1.encryptionKey=
    
    - KeyOwner maps to the User-ID of public key
        - partners1.keyOwner=
    
    - enabled can be "false" or "true". Set it to "true" to enable the partner extract.
        - partners1.enabled=
    
    <!--![Image of the PARTNER_EXTRACT configuration settings filled in.](../media/learning/sap-1.png)-->

Once you've completed these steps in the SuccessFactors portal, you'll need to complete the setup in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Configure the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Navigate to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Org settings**. Search for *Viva Learning* and enable SAP SuccessFactors from the options.

3. Fill in the configuration details.
