# Simulation automations for Attack simulation training

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To create a simulation automation, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Simulation automations** tab.

   To go directly to the **Simulation automations** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulationautomation>.

2. On the **Simulation automations** tab, select ![Create simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create simulation**.

   ![Create simulation button on the Simulation automations tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.](../../media/attack-sim-training-sim-automations-create.png)

3. The creation wizard opens. The rest of this article describes the pages and the settings they contain.

> [!NOTE]
> At any point during the simulation creation wizard, you can click **Save and close** to save your progress and continue configuring the simulation later. The incomplete simulation has the **Status** value **Draft** on the **Simulations** tab. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the simulation and clicking ![Edit simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** simulation.## Name and describe the simulation.

## Name and describe the simulation automation

On the **Automation name** page, configure the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the simulation.
- **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the simulation.

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Select one or more social engineering techniques

On the **Select social engineering techniques** page, select one or more of the available social engineering techniques, which were curated from the [MITRE ATT&CK® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/). Different payloads are available for different techniques. The following social engineering techniques are available:

- **Credential harvest**: Attempts to collect credentials by taking users to a well-known looking website with input boxes to submit a username and password.
- **Malware attachment**: Adds a malicious attachment to a message. When the user opens the attachment, arbitrary code is run that will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Link in attachment**: A type of credential harvest hybrid. An attacker inserts a URL into an email attachment. The URL within the attachment follows the same technique as credential harvest.
- **Link to malware**: Runs some arbitrary code from a file hosted on a well-known file sharing service. The message sent to the user will contain a link to this malicious file. Opening the file and help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Drive-by URL**: The malicious URL in the message takes the user to a familiar-looking website that silently runs and/or installs code code on the user's device.

If you click the **View details** link in the description, a details flyout opens that describes the technique and the simulation steps that result from the technique.

![Details flyout for the credential harvest technique on the Select social engineering techniques page.](../../media/attack-sim-training-simulations-select-technique-sim-steps.png)

When you're finished, click **Next**.

## Select payloads
