# Set up Microsoft Viva
Microsoft Viva is an organizing layer for employee experiences that puts people at the center, uniting them to share knowledge, skills, and connections in the natural flow of the workday. It delivers personalized and actionable insights when and where they’re needed in Teams, SharePoint, and other Microsoft 365 services. 

Microsoft Viva consists of four modules: Viva Topics, Viva Insights, Viva Learning, and Viva Connections. To set up the whole suite, you’ll set up each module individually.
 
### Start setting up

To jump right in and starting setting up, you'll have to be a Microsoft admin and be signed in to your account. 

[Go directly to the the Microsoft Viva admin page](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/featureexplorer/collections/VivaExperiences)

At the bottom of the page, select the module you want to set up.
On the module page, select the **Go to setup guide** button, or in the case of Viva Topics, select the **Get started** button to go to the Setup wizard that guides you through the process.
