    > [!IMPORTANT]

Your company name also appears in the admin center, where you manage Microsoft 365 users, licenses, and other features and services.
    >

You can now go to the Microsoft 365 admin center to add users, install Office apps, invite your team to use Microsoft 365 and more. We'll also send you an email with set up steps for Microsoft 365 Business Standard.

This option provides the easiest, fastest way to get started with the core functionality of the Office desktop suite, Teams, Forms and OneDrive cloud storage. This option is recommended for very small businesses who don't need branded email immediately, or who already use branded email from a different provider and do not intend to switch to use Microsoft Exchange.

<!--This option isn't recommended for larger businesses, including specialty industries such as healthcare or legal.-->

You can add a business domain at any point to access the rest of the functionality of your Business Standard subscription, including:

- Branded email, shared calendars within your business, Bookings appointment scheduling and Meeting recordings
- Shared document storage and SharePoint sites
- Microsoft Planner and Microsoft Lists
- The widest range of integrations of non-Microsoft apps (e.g. Salesforce, Adobe) that work within Teams and Office.

#### Next steps

If you would like to add a domain and create a business email account, you can follow the steps in the articles below:

- [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](../setup/add-domain.md)
- [Finish setting up](../setup/setup-business-standard.md#finish-setting-up)

### Option 2: Create a new business email account

With this option, you’ll be able to use Microsoft 365 Exchange as your professional, branded email provider. All your users will have a shared domain email address. For example, their username, followed by @contoso.com. You and your users sign into Microsoft 365 with this new email address. When you follow this process (add a domain and create new business email accounts), you’ll get access to all the features provided in Microsoft 365 Business Standard. For steps on how to buy or add a domain, see [Set up Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../setup/setup-business-standard.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a business email and what are the advantages to setting one up?

A business email is an email that uses your own domain name. For example, if you own the domain name `contoso.com`, you can build a website using the url `www.contoso.com`, but you can also have a custom email address such as yourname@contoso.com. This is referred to as a branded business email as it gives your email a professional look.

### How do I get a new business email address?

There are three options for getting a business email.

- You can use a suggested onmicrosoft.com domain for free (someone@mybusiness.onmicrosoft.com).
- You can buy a new domain to have a more compact email address (mybusinessname@contoso.com).
- You use a domain name that you already own.

### Why might I need to verify my domain to create a business email?

If you choose to use a domain you already own, you can use it for your email address with Microsoft 365. As part of sign up process, we ask you to verify the domain so you can send emails via Microsoft 365.  This confirms that you are the owner of the domain that is sending emails with that identity, which enhances security and prevents fraudulent activity.

### Is there a benefit to paying monthly vs annually?

To provide customers with the greatest amount of flexibility, different payment options are available.

- Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans are available for monthly commitment payment or annual commitment payment.
- Monthly commitment payment: You pay month by month, and you can cancel at any time.
- Annual commitment payment: You sign up for a one-year subscription, but you can choose to pay month to month or pay for the entire year at the time you sign up. There is a discount for using this payment option.

### How does recurring billing work?

When Recurring billing is on, your subscription will continue to be billed each year on the day you subscribed. You can turn it off or back on again in the admin center if your subscription is active. Learn more at [Turn recurring billing off or on](../../commerce/subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#turn-recurring-billing-off-or-on).

### What do I do if I want to change my business name?

Contact our small business support experts who can help you change your business name. Learn more at [Get support](../../business-video/get-help-support.md).
